Core Requirements
Game Board: Render a 3Ã—3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Each cell should be a clickable button or a div that responds to clicks.

Turns: The game should alternate between two players, "X" and "O". The first player is always "X".

Making a Move: When a player clicks on an empty cell, their mark (X or O) should appear in that cell. Clicking on an occupied cell should have no effect.

Winning Condition: The game must detect when a player has won. A win occurs when a player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

Game Status: Display a message to the user indicating the current state of the game. For example: "Next player: X", "Winner: O", or "It's a draw!".

Game Reset: Provide a button to reset the game and start over. This should clear the board and reset the game status.

Bonus Requirements (If time permits)
If you finish the core requirements with time to spare, consider adding one or more of the following features:

Move History: Display a list of past moves.

Time Travel: Allow the user to "jump back" to a specific move in the history.

Winning Line Highlight: Highlight the three cells that formed the winning line when the game ends.

Styling: Add some basic styling to make the game visually appealing. You can use any styling method you'd like (e.g., inline styles, CSS modules, Tailwind CSS).
